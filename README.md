Create a post with the tag 'homepage' and it will appear on the home page. Don't give anything else the 'homepage' tag, or you will eternally regret it.

## Post "cards"

Posts display as cards. Click on card to view the post. You'll have to add an image for each post so that it shows up pretty in the loop. Images should be at least 400 x 400px.
