# Read Me

## Home Page

Create a post with the tag 'homepage' and it will appear on the home page. Don't give anything else the 'homepage' tag, or you will eternally regret it.

## Post "cards"

For your different post categories (ie. tags), choose if you want the loop to show up as a gallery of 'cards' or as just the post itself, and stick to that choice for each category, because mixing cards and text won't look great.
